Ordinance That Allowed A Police Officer To \"Exercise Reasonable Judgment\" In Enforcing The Curfew Provided Far Too Much Leeway', 'Judge Is Skeptical The New Legislation Attempts To Correct The Vagueness Problem By Dictating That Any Curfew Ordinance \"Establish Clear Standards\" And Limit The Discretion Of Police Officers', 'However, Judge Haines, Who Is Now Retired, After Reading The Bill, Said In A Telephone Interview That He Considered It \"Totally Unnecessary\" Inasmuch As \"Municipalities Already Have The Right To Pass The Laws.\" \"Apart From That Is The Question Of Vagueness And Overbroadness,\" He Said', 'He Cited, For Example, A Provision Exempting Juveniles \"Engaged In, Or Traveling To Or From, A Business Or Occupation Which The Laws Of This State Authorize A Juvenile To Perform.\" \"It Seems To Me Thats Pretty Illusory,\" He Said', '\"Its A Wide-Open Loophole.\" The Bill Does Not Impose A Statewide Curfew, But It Allows A Municipality To Enact One So Long As It Clearly Spells Out Exceptions Like Attending School, Church Or Community Functions Or Going To Work', 'The Bill Authorizes Municipalities To \"Make It Unlawful For A Juvenile Of Any Age Under 18 Years, Within The Discretion Of The Municipality To Be On Any Public Street Or In A Public Place Between The Hours Of 10 Pm And 6 Pm Unless Accompanied By A Parent Or Guardian Or Unless Engaged In, Or

Bill Provides That \"If Both A Juvenile And The Juveniles Parent Or Guardian Violate Such An Ordinance, They Shall Be Required To Perform Community Service Together.\" The Legislation Requires That Any Ordinance Include Exceptions, Including Errands Involving Emergencies, Extracurricular School Activities, Religious Or Community-Based Activites \"And Other Cultural, Education And Social Events.\" Some Towns Around New York State Have Made Attempts At Imposing Curfews', 'But For The Most Part They, Too, Are Rarely Enforced, And Larger Cities Like Yonkers Have Been Deterred By Difficulties Of Enforcement And Warnings Of Challenges', 'Mr', 'Martone Said He Would Challenge New Curfew Ordinances That Flow From The Legislation On Several Grounds, Including What He Said Was An Abridgment Of First Amendment Guarantees Of \"Peaceable Assembly And Free Expression\" And Also The Right To Due Process And Equal Protection Under The Law', 'He Also Said He Feared That A Curfew Might Be Used Only Against Minority Youngsters', 'For The Children Senator Rice, Who Is Black, Said, \"I Dont Worry About That; If You Harass Us, Well Let You Know It.\" He Also Said That While He Hoped His Bill Would Help With Such Crime Problems As Car Theft, Which Is Rampant In Newark, The Major Aim Was Protection Of The Children Themselves', '\"I See Kids 11, 12, 13 Years Old, Boys And Girls, Out On The Streets At Night At 2 And 3 In The Morning', 'These Kids Will Eventually End Up With The Car Thieves, Or Raped; End Up With Trauma, With Aids, We Might Not Even Know About It, They Might Not Even Tell Us.\" As To Constitutional Questions, He Said, \"There Is No First Amendment Right That Denies Us The Ability To Protect Our Children.\" Mr', 'Rice Acknowledged That Newark Already Has A Curfew, But He Said That It Has Proved Unenforceable, Largely, He Maintained, Because Parents Were Not Held Responsible For Their Childrens Violations', '\"We Pick Up Kids, And The Youth House Wont Take Them Unless You Locate The Parents', 'So The Cops Have To Put Them Back On The Street', 'Some Of Them Go Out An Steal A Car To Get Home In,\" He Said.', 'After 2 1/2 Years Of False Starts
